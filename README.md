# Credit Risk Analytics for Smarter Lending Decisions

## Project Overview  

This project analyzes loan application data from Nova Bank to uncover patterns in borrower behavior and default risk across the USA, UK, and Canada. The goal is to support fair, data-driven lending policies that balance accessibility with financial protection.

As a credit risk analyst, I cleaned and prepared a dataset of over 32,000 loan applications using Python in Google Colab, addressing missing values, outliers, and feature engineering. The cleaned dataset was then exported to Excel and modeled in Power BI using a star-schema structure for dashboard development. This semantic model enables executive-level insights into borrower behavior, loan performance, and geographic risk segmentation.

### Business Objectives
- Identify borrower groups more or less likely to default  
- Explore how loan size, income, interest rates, and repayment terms affect risk  
- Assess the impact of employment type, home ownership, and credit history  
- Compare risk patterns across countries (USA, UK, Canada)  
- Recommend policy adjustments to improve lending fairness and reduce exposure
